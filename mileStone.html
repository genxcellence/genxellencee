	        <li> The annual recordkeeping fee covers services such as daily valuation recordkeeping, contribution tracking and full-service withholding and tax reporting. The recordkeeping fee in this report is based on the number of participants entered. </li>
	        <li> The plan credit amount is based on an approximate credit rate that is applied as follows: 0.40% for R-2, 0.25% for R-2E, 0.25% for R-3, 0.05% for R-4, 0.15% for R-5E, 0.05% for R-5 and 0.00% for R-6. The credit rate for non-American Funds may vary. Credits are applied quarterly on all plan assets except self-directed brokerage accounts and other investment options that are not reported on the service provider’s recordkeeping system. </li>
	        <li> For PlanPremier, credit rates may vary depending on a plan's investment options.</li>
	        <li> Average expense ratios are provided only as examples. The actual average expense ratio depends on the investments selected for the plan and participant allocations. Expense ratios reflect applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements, without which expenses would be higher.The average expense ratio for each share class is for all funded investments and is weighted, based on average daily net assets in the program as of 12/31/2018. Accordingly, more weight is given to funds with more assets. Actual expense ratios, as reported in each fund’s prospectus at the time of publication, range from 0.99% to 4.30% for R-2; 0.50% to 2.35% for R-2E; 0.64% to 3.57% for R-3; 0.35% to 3.55% for R-4; 0.02% to 1.93% for R-5E; 0.02% to 2.29% for R-5; 0.02% to 3.07% for R-6. Expense ratios for certain funds in some share classes are estimated. Please see fund prospectuses for details.</li>
	        <li> The third-party administrator (TPA) charges separately for administration services. The fee included in this estimate is fixed. The actual amount may vary if the TPA charges in basis points. </li>
	        <li> The plan’s financial professional charges separately for services. </li>
	        <li>Total annual costs are estimated. Fees for services that are not required for all plans, such as trustee/custodial and fiduciary services, are not included. Trustee and 403(b) custodial services are provided by Capital Bank & Trust Company for an annual fee of $750. Fiduciary services are available through Wilshire Associates Incorporated for an annual fee of 0.02% of plan assets for 3(21) services or 0.05% of plan assets for 3 (38) services. </li>
	        <li>Annual advisor compensation is derived from investment option payments (e.g. 12b-1 fees) for share classes R-2 through R-4 and is included in the funds' expense ratios (see annual investment cost). </li>
	        <li>The compensation available based on the investment option payments (e.g. 12b-1 fees) for the selected share class. </li>
	        <li> For compensation recapture, fee-based advisors may enter an amount less than the share class rate.</li>
	        <li>For PlanPremier, the difference between the share class rate and the adjusted fee-based rate, is added to the plan credit. </li>
	        <li>For PlanPremier, reducing the compensation rate through recapture for share classes R-2 through R-4 will create an Incremental Plan Credit. For this illustration, this amount will increase your plan credit. In practice, the recaptured share class compensation will be directed to an unallocated plan account where it can be used to pay the plan's advisor, reasonable plan administration expenses, or allocated to participant accounts.

	                    <h3> Retirement Plan Cost Estimate Based on Assets </h3>
	                    <p>PlanPremier-TPA®’s-annual credit can have a meaningful impact to the plan’s costs over time.</p>
	                    <p>How the credit works: The mutual funds in the plan generate recordkeeping payments to help pay for the plan’s recordkeeping and administrationfees. These payments, along with a portion of the distribution/service fees paid by the funds, are used to reduce American Fund ’s recordkeepingfees through the plan credit. The plan credit is generally based on the amount of assets in the plan and varies by share class. If the recordkeepingfees exceed the amount of the plan credit, the plan will be invoiced for the difference. If the plan credit exceeds the recordkeeping fees, the plan willreceive a net credit. The chart below illustrates the potential savings generated by the credit.</p>

	                    <p>PlanPremier-TPA®’s-annual credit can have a meaningful impact to the plan’s costs over time.</p>
	                    <p>How the credit works: The mutual funds in the plan generate recordkeeping payments to help pay for the plan’s recordkeeping and administrationfees. These payments, along with a portion of the distribution/service fees paid by the funds, are used to reduce American Fund ’s recordkeepingfees through the plan credit. The plan credit is generally based on the amount of assets in the plan and varies by share class.

	                    <p>PlanPremier-TPA®’s-annual credit can have a meaningful impact to the plan’s costs over time.</p>
	                    <p>How the credit works: The mutual funds in the plan generate recordkeeping payments to help pay for the plan’s recordkeeping and administrationfees. These payments, along with a portion of the distribution/service fees paid by the funds, are used to reduce American Fund ’s recordkeepingfees through the plan credit. The plan credit is generally based on the amount of assets in the plan and varies by share class. If the recordkeepingfees exceed the amount of the plan credit, the plan will be invoiced for the difference. If the plan credit exceeds the recordkeeping fees, the plan willreceive a net credit. The chart below illustrates the potential savings generated by the credit.</p>
